Let's cover perceptron vs sigmoid neuron

### Perceptron
A Perceptron takes several binary input and outputs a single binary output. Output is binary, so it means it just decides the response based on certain threshold value.

Output = 0 if sum(WiXi <= threshold)
       = 1 if sum(WiXi > threshold
       
Weights, w1, w2... are real numbers. Threshold is also real number.        
       
 Perceptron is like a device which makes decission by weighing on evidences.
